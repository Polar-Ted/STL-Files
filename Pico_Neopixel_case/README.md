The klipper led.cfg I am using needs the Klipper LED effects code installed on your Klipper Host.

You will need to edit the led.cfg to match your setup. 
THis is written to have 32 WS2812 LEDS on GPIO0  and the 2 8 WS2812 neopixel sticks in the Pico housing on GPIO2 and GPIO3

You will need 
4 x M3 nuts
4 x M3 30mm button or cap screws for closing the case. 
2 x M3 8mm cap screws and T nuts to mount on extrusion. 
4 x M2 8mm and M2x4 self tapping screws to mount the Pico
4 x M2 4mm self tapping screws to mount the Neopixel sticks. 
All I had was M2x8 so I cut them shorter for mounting the Neopixel boards.
